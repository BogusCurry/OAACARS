# OAACARS
OAAE's free-software ACARS client for X-Plane.

Designed for OAAE's VAM server, but should be easily adaptable to other virtual airline software by 
editing the HTTP queries in va.cpp to match what your software needs.

Windows binaries avaiable from Jenkins: [![Build Status](https://jenkins.maeyanie.com/buildStatus/icon?job=OAACARS)](https://jenkins.maeyanie.com/job/OAACARS)
